Image reconstruction is one of the most fundamental
inverse problems. With exemplar based impainting methods,
recent studies have proved that image reconstruction from
damaged samples is highly efficient without lose of continuity
and texture based abnormalities. This study is a first step to
work with exemplar based impainting methods for removing
an undesired object from background by pixel priority
determination and replacing the pitch window with the best
possible patch from undamaged image. Pixel window with
least sum of square of differnce value is used to update the
undesirable patch

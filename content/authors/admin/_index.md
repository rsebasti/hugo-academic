I am a research associate at the Neurosurgery Department at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. 
I aspire to pursue Ph.D. training at the intersection of neuroscience and engineering. My research interests are evolving. 
I am primarily interested in neural signal processing with an emphasis on rehabilitation and neuromodulation centered on therapeutic benefit.  
  
  I grew up in Kochi, one of the southern cities of India. Apart from my mother tongue, Malayalam, I speak English and Hindi fluently. 
Being a linguaphile, I am learning Spanish at present. In my spare time, I write poetry, watch movies, read philosophical fiction, and do journaling.

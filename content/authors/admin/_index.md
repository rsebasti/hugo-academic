My name is Rinu. I am a research associate at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. My goal is to pursue Ph.D. training in the intersection of digital signal processing and bio-inspired technologies. 
I work on analysing intracranial neural signals alongside post-docs at Dr.Brian Lee's lab under the department of Neurosurgery.

I grew up in Kochi, one of the southern cities of India. In my spare time, I write poetry, watch movies, read philosophical fiction, pick up Spanish and piano lessons and do journaling.
